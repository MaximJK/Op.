# Complete JWT Authentication with Django & React
By: Stuart Leitch

This GitHub repo accompanies my tutorial on the subject of how to use JWT Authentication with Django and React.

If you want to use React as a frontend with Django Rest Framework as a backend, you'll notice that getting the Authentication system set up presents one of the largest early hurdles. Follow this tutorial to build a really ugly website demonstrating the process from start to finish, including Custom Users, refreshing tokens, and protected views. It's the tutorial I wish I had when I first started.

The full tutorial on Medium lives here:
